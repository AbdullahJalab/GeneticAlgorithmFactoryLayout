# Genetic Algorithm for Factory Layout

This project implements a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize the layout of a factory with multiple rooms. The algorithm aims to find an optimal arrangement that minimizes material flow cost and improves efficiency.

## 🚀 Features
- Uses multiple crossover operators (OX, CX, PMX, etc.).
- Implements mutation strategies like reversion, swap, and insertion.
- Evaluates solutions based on distance and cost functions.
- Supports customizable parameters for population size, generations, and mutation rates.

## 🛠️ Installation
1. Ensure you have MATLAB installed.
2. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/AbdullahJalab/GeneticAlgorithmFactoryLayout.git

##Usage
Run the main script in MATLAB:
